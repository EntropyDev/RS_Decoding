Used Python 3, sympy and Numpy

I was able to do all the three questions.
Got correct outputs for all. 
But in Q2 RM(20,10) was taking very long for execution.I tired running on Google Colab and even after an hour, it was still running.
And in Q3 also, RM(15,1) was taking too long, so I decoded for (10,1).
Outputs are in files output1.txt, output2.txt, output3.txt respectively.


Thank you.
